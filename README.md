I  graduated with a masters degree in Computer Science at Northeastern University in December 2023. I have successfully contributed to a range of projects, showcasing proficiency in areas such as web application, mobile applications, game development(Java,C++) and system optimization.

I interned at Amdocs Inc, Plano, TX where I worked for AT&T Direct TV's "Base Value Management" project, I optimized features, automated campaign processes, and implemented real-time functionalities. This experience honed my ability to blend front-end aesthetics with back-end efficiency, ensuring a holistic and user-centric approach.

I also worked at Nokia for 8 months as a Software QA Coop where I actively contributed to enhancing internal testing frameworks. I implemented parallel execution for improved speed, designed and executed Pytest test suites, and addressed intricate issues in intraday job processes. This experience heightened my attention to detail and commitment to delivering reliable and efficient software solutions.

These diverse experiences have equipped me with a comprehensive skill set spanning various technologies, methodologies, and project types. As an enthusiastic team player, I am eager to seize learning opportunities and contribute to the creation of innovative, cutting-edge web applications. My dedication to excellence and passion for staying at the forefront of technology make me a valuable asset for any dynamic development team.
